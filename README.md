# Personal Assistant

This desktop app uses the OpenAI API and stores chats in a Google Sheet.
To run it, you need an OpenAI key and Google credentials.
The app now checks that all required environment variables are set
and will exit with a helpful message if any are missing.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace the example values in `.env` with your own keys.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the app with `npm start`.
